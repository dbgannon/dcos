This is the simple docker container used in the blog post on www.esciencegroup.com entitled 
"Azure Container Services Are Now Live: An Initial Look".   It is pretty simple.  the full description is in the blog post.
Note: the generic-worker.py file does not contain the needed password and id for the rabbitmq service or the azure table service name and authentication strings.   you will need to do those yourself if you plan to run this.
